# ADR: C01 minimum company control plane (org + workspace RBAC)

- **Status:** Accepted (minimum viable)
- **Date:** 2026-09-10 (America/Sao_Paulo)
- **Decision:** Extend the existing workspace membership model with an
  optional **organization** parent and `admin` | `member` roles, without
  breaking personal `owner` installs. SSO / audit erasure remain C02.
- **Worker:** C01-RBAC — org/workspace model + authorization gates

| Better Auth (`db/schema/auth.ts`)    | `user` / `session` / `account` / `verification`                        | No org plugin; keep as identity provider only          |
| `workspaces`                         | Id + `created_at` only                                                 | No company parent                                      |

| `accessScopeForUser` / `ensureScope` | Mints `personal:<hash>` + owner membership                             | Must keep working unchanged for personal path          |
| `scopeFromPrincipal`                 | Personal workspace binding only                                        | Company workspace selection is a later product surface |
| Blueprint                            | Private workspaces first; team sharing needs explicit membership/grant | Company control plane missing                          |

## Decision

1. **Organizations** (`organizations`, `organization_memberships`) are the B2B
   control-plane tenant. Roles: `admin` | `member`.
2. **Workspaces** gain nullable `organization_id`:
   - `NULL` → personal workspace (existing install path).
   - set → company workspace under that org.
3. **Workspace roles** widen to `owner` | `admin` | `member`:
   - Personal: **`owner` only** (helpers enforce).
   - Company: **`admin` | `member` only** (helpers enforce; never assign
     `owner` on company workspaces).
4. **Authorization helpers** (`shared/identity/org-rbac.ts`, authorized):
   - Admin/owner may manage members.
   - Member cannot elevate (cannot grant `admin`).
   - Typed `RbacDenied` fails closed.
5. **DB service** (`db/services/organizations.ts`) applies those gates when
   creating company workspaces / setting membership roles. `ensureScope`
   remains the personal provisioning path (`role: "owner"`).
6. **Migration** `0029_org-workspace-rbac` adds tables/column and widens the
   role CHECK with `NOT VALID` + `VALIDATE` (authorized adoption).
7. **Removal ends issued authority** (`server/workspaces/team.ts`
   `removeWorkspaceMember`). `agent_sessions`, `scheduled_agent_jobs`, their
   runs and rendered report outputs cascade from the membership row. Before
   deleting it, removal cancels the queued `channel_outbox` rows of those
   reports, revokes the `workspace_agent_grants` the member issued for the
   workspace's bots, cancels open `agent_protocol_tasks` on those grants, and
   records `removedSessions`, `removedJobs`, `cancelledOutbox`,
   `revokedGrants` and `canceledTasks` in the `member_removed` receipt.
   Use-time gates (`requireWorkspaceAccess`, `ensureScope`,
   `getWorkspaceGoogleToken`) deny the removed member on the next request,
   message or scheduled run. A shared Google connection stays in workspace
   custody and never follows a person into a personal space. A group binding
   grants access only while it is unrevoked and points at a workspace the
   sender belongs to.

## Alternatives considered

- **Better Auth organization plugin as source of truth:** deferred — would
  couple product RBAC to Auth plugin migrations and risk personal-path churn;
  C02 may revisit for SSO.
- **Replace `owner` with `admin` everywhere:** rejected — breaks existing
  personal membership rows and `ensureScope`.
- **Workspace-of-workspaces without `organizations` table:** rejected — need a
  clear company tenant for member management independent of any one workspace.

## Out of scope (follow-ups)

- **C02** SSO audit / erasure, IdP suite, invite emails.
- UI for org switching / invites.
- G02 group shared-memory policy (do not collide; this PR stays on
  auth/org/membership).
- Last-admin resignation locks (helper reason reserved; not enforced yet).

## Consequences

- Existing personal installs keep working: `ensureScope` + `owner` unchanged.
- Company features must call org RBAC gates before mutating memberships.
- `tests/runtime/workspace-boundaries.integration.ts` proves against real
  PostgreSQL that a copied workspace id grants nothing without a membership,
  that a guest reaches only the granted workspace, that removal ends sessions,
  jobs, grants, tasks and the shared Google connection for the removed member,
  that a group principal cannot reach a personal space, and that an accepted
  invitation cannot be answered again. `workspace-team.integration.ts` covers
  revoked, expired and wrong-recipient invitations.
- Schema tests / drizzle snapshot include org tables; no secrets in tree.
