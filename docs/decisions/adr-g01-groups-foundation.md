# ADR: G01 groups foundation (Telegram + Kapso/WA)

- **Status:** Accepted (foundation only)
- **Date:** 2026-09-10 (America/Sao_Paulo)
- **Decision:** **proceed** authorized group/supergroup detection, private
  `channel_identity` binding skeleton, and mention/policy gate (no spam).
- **Worker:** G01 — inventory + foundation PR (skip live group e2e G03 / deep
  shared-memory G02 unless hooks required)

## Inventory (verified on `origin/main` @ 16a5859)

## Decision

1. **Detect** Telegram `group`/`supergroup` and Kapso group flags through
   `server/channels/group-policy.ts` (authorized pure helpers + binding operation).
2. **Ingress policy (no spam):** Telegram group messages are accepted **only**
   when the bot is `@mentioned` or the message replies to the bot. Bare group
   chatter stays `[]`. Kapso/WA groups remain closed until provider mention
   signals exist (G03).
3. **Identity bind skeleton:** `bindGroupChannelIdentity` maps a linked private
   `channel_identity.id` + group `chatId` to
   `conversationScope = group:<channel>:<installation>:<chatId>` and
   `deliveryTargetId = chatId`. **No schema migration / DB writes** in G01.
4. **Inbound coordinates** gain optional `chatKind` + `chatId`. Private events
   set `chatKind: "private"` and `chatId` to the private peer id. Login
   `/start`/`/confirm` never mint from group scope.
5. **Out of scope here:** live group e2e (G03), shared group memory (G02),
   outbound group sends, Kapso group acceptance, membership/admin grants.

## Alternatives considered

- **Keep hard-drop forever until full membership model:** rejected — blocks
  mention-gated foundation and identity-scope design proofs.
- **New `channel_identity` row per group chat:** rejected — would conflate
  conversation scope with actor identity; blueprint keeps sender identity
  `(installation, provider, external sender ID)`.
- **Accept all group messages then filter downstream:** rejected — spam risk
  and contradicts blueprint “disabled until properties proved.”

## Follow-ups

- **G02** shared-memory / workspace membership for group scopes (policy + stub landed in `adr-g02-groups-memory-policy.md`).
- **G03** see `adr-g03-groups-live-e2e.md` (TG harness/live; Kapso open-if-mention; WA gap).
- Outbound WA group JID send still deferred after G03.
- Principal `conversationId` currently equals `identity.id` (private); group
  delivery must switch to `conversationScope` when enqueue is wired.
