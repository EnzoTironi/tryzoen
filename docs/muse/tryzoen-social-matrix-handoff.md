# Social/Matrix implementation handoff

Updated 2026-09-28 from the user-provided `tryzoen-social-matrix-handoff.md` and HUMA PDF. This reconciles that handoff with the running code; it does not replace Muse parity work or claim a completed social client.

## Direction and proposals

The user wants personal agents, official specialist/creator agents, real people and communities, with iMessage-inspired conversations and a desktop sidebar. Matrix is the chosen communication feasibility candidate. Eve remains the execution owner; Zoen owns accounts, grants, subscriptions, goals and published content.

The proposed `Conversas / Descobrir / Meu espaço` navigation and photography pilot are not final commitments. Preserve existing Muse capabilities. Mark official AI identities clearly; a creator and their AI are different senders. Paid AI access does not imply unlimited personal access to the creator.

## Existing implementation to reuse

## Required feasibility slice

Use two synthetic people and an explicitly identified community agent. Exchange messages between web and real Expo development builds on iOS/Android. Restart/disconnect/reconnect and prove ordering, retry deduplication, device-key persistence, recovery, encrypted history policy, push-to-room navigation and agent grant/revocation. Browser WASM/IndexedDB SDK support is not proof of React Native support; qualify a maintained Rust SDK bridge before selecting it. Record compatible versions and licenses.

Backend entitlement checks govern access. Revocation removes future access under a documented history policy; it cannot retract plaintext already delivered. A room admitting an agent explains authorized model processing. Personal memory, expert-published knowledge and community context have distinct boundaries; see [Akita adoption](file-memory.md).

## HUMA: useful behaviors and evidence limits

Reference: Jacniacki and Carmona Serrat, _Humanlike Multi-user Agent (HUMA): Designing a Deceptively Human AI Facilitator for Group Chats_, [arXiv 2511.17315v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17315). The supplied nine-page PDF was read and the architecture figure visually inspected.

The useful separation is attention/strategy routing, action execution and bounded reflection. New events can interrupt a pending response; silence is valid. The paper serializes message sends and retains pending intentions across interruptions. Apply these ideas within Eve and durable Matrix delivery, without adding another runtime.

Zoen participation starts with mentions, explicit actions or a scoped ongoing responsibility. Each event needs a durable receipt; concurrent replies must not cause loops, duplicate messages or repeated charges. Reevaluate pending actions after newer messages. Keep reflection room-scoped; never promote chat text into permission or private memory automatically. Full-history context is not a bounded production implementation. Deceptive identity and artificial human typing delays are not requirements: our agents stay visibly identified as AI.

The study involved 97 participants in short roleplayed generative-art chats (41 human facilitator, 56 AI). It does not establish long-term trust, retention, moderation safety or autonomous expert accuracy. Human means were higher on three of four reported experience scales; near-chance identity detection is not equivalence evidence. HUMA informs participation, not the temporal memory architecture; Akita is the selected memory reference.

## Delivery sequence

1. Preserve Muse flows and the shared Markdown editor.
2. Qualify Matrix platform transport, encryption and recovery with the fixture above.
3. Implement explicit specialist publishing and scoped knowledge, never a copy of the creator's entire personal memory.
4. Add scoped community participation, observable interruptions, deduplicated delivery and bounded context.
5. Enforce entitlement/revocation before paid access. Pricing and final navigation remain product decisions.
6. Measure useful outcomes, second-specialist discovery, retention, recall accuracy and cost. Message/account counts alone are not success or capacity proof.

No new Expo Matrix transport, device encryption proof, creator billing or HUMA router was introduced merely by adding this handoff.
