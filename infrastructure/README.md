# Zoen infrastructure

`alchemy.run.ts` is the entry point for local development and hosted production.
The hosted stack uses Alchemy 2.0.0-beta.76 native Fly, Docker and Cloudflare
providers. PostgreSQL is self-hosted; no managed Postgres product is provisioned.

All machines remain running. PostgreSQL, memory, Matrix and the WhatsApp bridge have no public service or IP.
Fly private networking carries their traffic. The memory and Matrix database
logins cannot connect to the application database. Application credentials are
Fly vault secrets; they do not enter Git, image layers or public CI artifacts.

The root agent keeps the `codex-local` profile. Browser execution has its own
explicit provider and vision model: production uses `codex-local` with
`gpt-5.6-luna` at low reasoning through the existing ChatGPT login. The coordinator
also uses Luna after it passed all 55 native launch gates; Spark remains configurable
but failed the Spanish persistence scenario and does not accept images. The native launch suite uses this same pair. Other
installations default to Gateway with `meta/muse-spark-1.3`; set
`COMPANION_BROWSER_MODEL_PROVIDER` and `COMPANION_BROWSER_MODEL` to change that
selection. There is no automatic provider or model fallback. The browser resolves
the live provider at each model step, as required by Eve's serialization contract,
and rejects anonymous, shared and scheduled-report sessions before resolution.
When explicitly selected, OpenRouter browser calls cap output at 4,096 tokens, including reasoning, rather
than reserving the framework's 65,536-token default. Public web search belongs to
that gated worker; the root retains scoped, read-only URL fetching.

This is one database machine, not automatic high availability. A host outage
requires recovery, and an image update can cause a brief restart. Production
operation here means measured recovery, monitored backups and controlled changes;
it does not imply zero downtime or guaranteed zero data loss.

## Deployment

Use Node 24 and the pinned pnpm version, then install both packages:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --dir infrastructure install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --dir infrastructure types:check
```

Production configuration lives in an ignored, mode-0600
`infrastructure/.env.prod`. It contains the current application secret values,
`COMPANION_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `FLY_API_TOKEN`, `ZOEN_DNS_API_TOKEN`, and
`ZOEN_CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`. The DNS token is restricted to tironi.xyz. Cloudflare
OAuth is used locally for state bootstrap; CI uses the already-provisioned state
service token and does not need an interactive login.

`ZOEN_RELEASE` must be the full tested Git commit SHA. Alchemy builds and pushes
Linux amd64 images and deploys their immutable digests. Optional
`ZOEN_POSTGRES_IMAGE`, `ZOEN_MEMORY_IMAGE`, `ZOEN_MATRIX_IMAGE`, `ZOEN_VAULTWARDEN_IMAGE`, and `ZOEN_WEB_IMAGE` digest references
support adoption or a deliberate rollback. Keep the database on PostgreSQL major
17; a major upgrade requires a separate migration and recovery plan.
Which SHA has actually been published is recorded in the
[customer-platform release map](../docs/decisions/adr-customer-platform-release.md);
REL02 stays blocked until that SHA's images, recovery drill and health checks
are written down. Do not use Eve's generic deploy.

Alchemy creates separate `zoen_app` and `zoen_migrator` logins with independent
vault secrets. The runtime has DML and native workflow queue permissions, no DDL,
superuser, role creation, database creation, replication or RLS bypass. It cannot
assume the migrator role. Graphile's private queue tables have an explicit runtime
policy; the application does not become their owner to bypass RLS.

One Alchemy action prepares the application, memory, Matrix and Vaultwarden databases in
sequence. Their scripts update shared PostgreSQL catalogs and database permissions,
so independent parallel actions can conflict. Migrations and service updates depend
on the completed preparation, including all four credential versions.

Before switching the web image, the stack takes an incremental backup and runs
`scripts/migrate-hosted.ts` in a temporary machine with no public services, DNS
registration or persistent volume. It checks the ordered migration hashes and
timestamps before and after applying application and native workflow migrations.
A mismatch fails the release instead of repairing the journal. The temporary
machine is removed on success or failure; grants are reconciled before web startup.

```sh
cd infrastructure
pnpm exec alchemy plan --stage prod --env-file "$PWD/.env.prod"
pnpm exec alchemy deploy --stage prod --env-file "$PWD/.env.prod" --yes
pnpm check:production
```

Inspect the plan: the production PostgreSQL volume must never be replaced implicitly.
Their exact IDs are pinned in `production.ts`. Changes to those IDs are recovery
operations, not routine deployment. Apps, machines, volumes, backup
storage and encryption keys are retained on stack removal. Do not use `--force`
or `destroy` as a way to clear an adoption error.

The web service uses `WebPersistent` and a dedicated encrypted `model_auth`
volume. Fly cannot attach a volume on another physical host to an existing
machine. The first migration creates `zoen-web` on that volume, checks its exact
image, mount and `alive` readiness check, then removes public services from the
legacy machine and stops it. Alchemy retains the old machine for recovery; the
database is unchanged. Repeated deployments update the persistent web machine.
If readiness fails, the cutover never stops the serving legacy machine.

For an application rollback, keep this infrastructure definition and set
`ZOEN_WEB_IMAGE` to a previously verified immutable image digest, then plan and
deploy through Alchemy. Do not revert the infrastructure to the old unmounted
machine or undo database migrations. Check migration compatibility before using
an older image. Clear the image override before the next normal release.

Local/dev stages use Docker through `local.ts`, preserving the existing
CompanionLocal stack and volumes. They do not use the hosted production database.
`alchemy.fly-postgres.run.ts` remains a compatibility alias for the unified stack.

## Native Codex authentication

The web image installs the official Codex CLI, pinned to `0.155.1`. Eve's native
`chatgpt()` model uses its app-server authentication. `CODEX_HOME` points to
`/root/.eve/auth/codex` on the encrypted retained `model_auth` volume, with
`cli_auth_credentials_store="file"` in its configuration. The production model
remains `gpt-5.6-luna`.

`CODEX_AUTH_JSON` must contain the complete native `auth.json` from a managed
ChatGPT login (`auth_mode: "chatgpt"` and access, refresh and ID tokens). The
entrypoint validates the seed before replacing any retained login, writes it
with mode 600 only when absent or the deployment seed changes, and removes the
seed from its environment. Codex owns refresh; restarting with the same seed
preserves the renewed file. An unavailable native login prevents startup when
either configured model uses `codex-local`.

Use a dedicated login for production. Follow the official
[headless authentication instructions](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/auth#login-on-headless-devices)
to prepare the native credential and transfer it through the protected
`ZOEN_PRODUCTION_ENV` configuration. Never bake credentials into images or print
them in logs. The obsolete Eve plaintext credential seed is no longer consumed.

## Backups and recovery

Account erasure uses a separate private Tigris bucket, retained by Alchemy.
The application writes deletion intent there before removing active data.
`pnpm start` replays the journal before starting either Next or Eve; failure
keeps the restored service closed. Never restore or delete this bucket as part
of a PostgreSQL rollback. Its credentials are separate from pgBackRest's.
For other installations, configure the `ZOEN_ERASURE_JOURNAL_*` variables in
`.env.example`; without them, full-account erasure is unavailable. CI proves
this path with real S3 and a full PostgreSQL backup taken before deletion.

pgBackRest archives WAL continuously (`archive_timeout=60s`). The target recovery
point is about one minute plus upload delay while the archive is healthy; this
is a target, not a guarantee during a storage/network outage. Backups run in UTC:
full Sunday at 02:17, differential other days at 02:17, incremental other hours
at :17. Three full backups retain at least two weekly intervals and the WAL
needed to restore them. Fly volume snapshots are retained for 14 days as a second
recovery path.

The database image supervises PostgreSQL and the cron scheduler. Failed initial
backups do not take the database offline. The external CI probe checks the
repository itself, fails if the newest backup is older than 150 minutes, and
checks WAL archive failures, alerts at 85% disk usage, and probes the private
Mem0 and Matrix endpoints through the Fly network, and verifies application role
restrictions. GitHub workflow failure notifications provide the
alert path. Cron execution on GitHub can be delayed; it is an operational probe,
not a real-time availability SLA.

Run a real production recovery drill through Alchemy:

```sh
cd infrastructure
ZOEN_RECOVERY_RUN=manual-20260913 pnpm recover:production
```

`recovery.run.ts` creates an encrypted temporary volume and an isolated machine,
restores from the encrypted object repository, runs pg_amcheck, reports only
structural results, and deletes both temporary resources. The proof requires the
application, Mem0 and Matrix databases and their restricted roles. The machine has no
public services and is excluded from application DNS. It cannot archive WAL or
write backups. An optional `ZOEN_RESTORE_TARGET` timestamp selects point-in-time
recovery. No step changes the live volume or promotes the test machine.

For a real incident: restore to an isolated replacement first; verify integrity,
application schema and memory; stop writes to the old instance; update the pinned
machine/volume identities only after validation. Preserve the old volume until
rollback is no longer required. Encryption keys and state-service access must be
recoverable independently of the failed PostgreSQL machine.

## CI

`Checks` builds this exact PostgreSQL image, tests encrypted backup, WAL replay,
pgvector recovery and role isolation, runs the real Mem0 adapter against pgvector,
and runs application checks, database integration tests and the production build.
Runtime tests migrate twice as the migrator, execute as the restricted application
role, deliver an actual Graphile HTTP job, and exercise a real private Synapse.

`Zoen infrastructure` runs only on main, serializes deployments and requires a
successful complete Checks run and native launch eval run on the exact commit
before a production deploy.
Every deployment ends with an isolated production recovery drill. The same drill
runs every Sunday at 04:47 UTC, after the scheduled full backup. Temporary recovery
resources are removed even if verification fails.
Its protected configuration is supplied by `ZOEN_PRODUCTION_ENV` and
`ZOEN_ALCHEMY_STATE`. The uptime workflow uses `ZOEN_FLY_OPERATIONS_TOKEN` scoped to the database
and Vaultwarden apps; no application secrets are required by its probe.
Rotate Fly deploy/probe tokens before their 90-day expiry. State and backup
credentials are never included in uploaded artifacts.

`Zoen native agent evals` is manually dispatched and uses an isolated `CODEX_HOME`.
Before **each** dispatch, create a fresh dedicated managed Codex login and replace
`CODEX_AUTH_JSON` inside the protected `ZOEN_EVAL_PROVIDERS` repository secret,
preserving its `KERNEL_API_KEY`. The runner discards that CI grant after the run;
it has no secret-write permission and does not maintain reusable CI credentials.
Never copy an active desktop or production refresh grant into CI. Production
refresh remains independent on its retained volume. This follows the official
[one-grant-per-stream requirement](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/auth/ci-cd-auth)
without adding a secret writer or storing auth in build artifacts.

## Matrix operations

The app exposes authenticated room screens; Synapse is private and has no public
registration, federation or media API. Each room is explicitly bound to one
workspace. Earlier history is visible only from the member's Matrix join event.
Zoen is activated by a mention. Each message and tool call checks current workspace
and room membership. A native Eve job reconciles revoked members every minute;
web access is denied immediately, including while that reconciliation is pending.

Alchemy retains the homeserver signing seed, application-service tokens and database
password. Reuse these secrets when restoring the database. Rotating the signing seed
casually changes homeserver identity. Never expose application-service tokens to
the browser. The callback `/_matrix/app/v1/transactions/*` requires the homeserver
token even though it is excluded from browser sign-in middleware.

This release provides team rooms inside Zoen. Federation, end-to-end encryption,
public Matrix-client sign-in and file attachments are not enabled. See
[Matrix source and license](matrix/README.md).

## Alchemy compatibility patch

`patches/alchemy@2.0.0-beta.76.patch` extends the native Fly.Machine provider with
explicit existing-machine/volume adoption and machine checks. It verifies the
physical identities before mutation, reads actual volume metadata, and refuses
an empty replacement if an expected machine or volume is missing. This addresses
adoption of pre-existing machines without Alchemy labels. It also compares
normalized autostop values: the API returns `false` for `"off"`, and comparing
them literally causes unnecessary restarts. The patch waits for transient machine
states during updates instead of sending a second start request, with a bounded
three-minute startup wait. `pnpm test:providers` exercises these transitions and
ensures unrelated API errors still fail the deployment. Remove the patch only when an
upstream version supports these behaviors and the adoption/recovery
proofs still pass. The provider remains native; provisioning is not a shell
wrapper around flyctl.

## Vaultwarden operations

Alchemy declares the official image digest, database role, SSO secret, public TLS
endpoint `vault.zoen.tironi.xyz`, encrypted volume and private Tigris backup
repository. All three generated passwords (database, SSO client and restic) are
retained in Alchemy state and Fly secrets; none are user master passwords.
Back up access to the encrypted Alchemy state separately from the database.
`vaultwarden/README.md` describes recovery, maintenance and rotation.

The health probe also checks the latest remote Vaultwarden snapshot and disk
usage. Before activating this revision, refresh the operations token with both
app scopes; its previous database-only token cannot inspect the vault machine.
The deploy workflow requires the vault probe; set the repository variable
`ZOEN_VAULT_PROBE_ENABLED=true` after deployment to enable the scheduled probe.
Until then the existing database monitor explicitly reports that the vault probe
is inactive, avoiding false incidents before the service exists.
Vaultwarden's own public health endpoint reports process liveness only.
