## Landing page reference assets

The reference illustrations and channel icons under `public/marketing/`
(`scattered-notes.avif`, `calendar.avif`, `companion-face.webp`, `office.webp`,
`park.webp`, `whatsapp.avif` and `telegram.avif`) reproduce assets from the
[Portuguese Memorae landing](https://memorae.ai/pt/) at the project owner's
request on 2026-09-12. They originate from `cdn.memorae.ai/l3/` and the public
Memorae image endpoint. They retain their original third-party ownership and
are not covered by this repository's original-code license. The landing's
Zoen copy and interactive examples are authored for this project.

The `sky-*.webp` images and the base phone mockups are AI-generated marketing
artwork created for this project. The `zoen-whatsapp.webp`,
`zoen-imessage.webp`, `zoen-telegram.webp`, `zoen-avatar.webp` and
`zoen-favicon.png` assets incorporate the mascot reference supplied by the
project owner on 2026-09-12. The phone screens illustrate the intended Zoen
experience; the messaging product names belong to their respective owners.

## PI OAuth protocol references

The device-code adapters in `server/models/oauth.ts` use protocol details from [PI](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/ai/src/auth/oauth) (OpenAI Codex and xAI adapters). Zoen implements credential custody, workspace authorization and refresh serialization independently. Public OAuth client identifiers do not grant provider entitlement.
