# Zoen

**Less on your mind. More in your life.**

Zoen is an open-source assistant for personal and team workspaces. Talk to it in
the web app or a connected messenger, give it useful skills, and keep control of
the accounts, files and actions it can access.

**Stage: free closed beta.** This repository is actively developed. The
[customer-platform release map](docs/decisions/adr-customer-platform-release.md)
says what is installed, fixture-tested, unavailable or missing live proof. The
[qualification ledger](docs/decisions/adr-qualification-ledger.md) and
[launch ledger](docs/decisions/zoen-launch-validation.md) keep those kinds of
evidence separate. A green badge is not a live-provider pass.

## What it does

- A visual web app in English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese, with personal
  and work spaces, conversations, recipes, connections and account controls.
- Google sign-in through Better Auth; Telegram and WhatsApp use short-lived
  requests confirmed in the user's private messenger conversation.
- An owned Executor catalog for tools, plugins and Git-backed skills. Eve uses
  Code Mode to discover capabilities and performs mutations through exact-input
  approvals and current workspace permissions.
- Versioned files and agent instructions, personal memory through Mem0, scheduled
  work, browser tasks and explicit Google Workspace connections.
- Operational traces, scoped diagnostics and configurable beta telemetry to
  investigate failed journeys without making private workspaces public.

Telegram group support is being qualified. Ordinary WhatsApp groups are **not
enabled** by the current Kapso Cloud API setup. iMessage and paid checkout are
unavailable during this beta. Vaultwarden and the user WhatsApp bridge have
PostgreSQL envelopes and fail closed without live servers; they are not
activated product integrations. Beeper Desktop is not installed. Reference
catalogs under `docs/recipe-integrations/` are research, not a list of
activated product capabilities.

Trusted networks now have a customer interface: invite and accept a person, find
a published bot, and converse through private Matrix rooms and native Eve/A2A.
Company discovery uses current membership. Personal files and tools are excluded
from conversation grants. Real Synapse and two-account browser proofs are recorded
in the [network validation](docs/decisions/zoen-network-validation.md). Hosted
activation, E2EE and federation are separate qualification gates.

## Architecture

| Layer                      | Responsibility                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Next.js + React            | App, onboarding and authenticated browser interface          |
| Better Auth + PostgreSQL   | Identity, sessions, memberships and access boundaries        |
| Eve + owned Executor       | Durable agent execution, discovery, approval and tool calls  |
| Git + Mem0                 | Versioned durable content and scoped memory (Mem0 until P10) |
| `@zoen/operon`             | Embedded domain types and OCC store; not mounted on startup  |
| Matrix + A2A adapters      | Collaboration and agent interoperability boundaries          |
| Alchemy + Fly + Cloudflare | Declared deployment, private services, TLS and operations    |

Git branches are not authorization boundaries. Personal credentials and memories
do not become team or group data just because the same person uses both spaces.
Secrets stay outside Git. `@zoen/operon` is a compile-time workspace package and
is not provided to the Effect runtime until Mem0 is removed. The G0 live door is
authenticated `/chat` on the same application PostgreSQL. See
[G0 baseline](docs/decisions/g0-baseline.md).

## Run locally

Use **Node.js 24**, **pnpm 11.24.0** and PostgreSQL. Docker is needed for the
isolated infrastructure and integration tests.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
cp .env.example .env.local
chmod 600 .env.local
```

Set the database URLs, application URL and independent authentication/encryption
keys in `.env.local`. Choose and authenticate a supported model provider. Never
reuse production credentials or a production database for local tests.

Follow [self-hosting](docs/self-host.md) and the
[Alchemy infrastructure guide](infrastructure/README.md) to provision PostgreSQL,
roles, optional services and provider configuration. With that environment ready:

```sh
node --env-file=.env.local --run db:migrate
node --env-file=.env.local --run workflow:migrate
node --env-file=.env.local --run build
pnpm start --port 3000
```

The launcher owns both Next and Eve and stops the sibling if either exits. Eve's
internal interface stays on loopback. Connectors need their own credentials and
verified webhook setup. Provider subscriptions, terms and quotas still apply when
you bring an existing model account.

Production deployment uses the **Zoen infrastructure** GitHub workflow and
Alchemy, not Eve's generic deploy. Publication must use the same SHA that
passed checks, with recorded image digests, an isolated recovery drill and live
health checks. That publication (REL02) has not been run for this stack. See the
[release map](docs/decisions/adr-customer-platform-release.md) and
[operations guide](docs/ops/README.md). The Vercel CLI is not part of this
installation's deployment toolchain.

## Validate and contribute

```sh
pnpm check --concurrency=1
node --env-file=.env.local --run db:check
pnpm eval:list
pnpm audit
pnpm --dir infrastructure audit
```

`pnpm test:runtime` requires the dedicated `companion_runtime_test` database and
an ignored `.env.runtime.local`. It must never run against production.
`pnpm db:reset -- --confirm <database-name>` only targets the disposable
allowlist on a local host and refuses `open_instinct_prod` and hosted
databases before connecting. `pnpm eval:ci` needs an isolated loopback app
plus model/browser credentials; listing cases is not a live grade. See
[release gates](docs/decisions/adr-customer-platform-release.md) and
[reproduction instructions](docs/decisions/zoen-launch-validation.md#reproducing-native-evaluations).

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a change. Use issue forms
for reproducible bugs and feature proposals, and keep credentials and real
customer conversations out of public reports. Security concerns go through
[private vulnerability reporting](SECURITY.md), not public issues.
