# Browser account controls

`controls.ts` exposes `readLinkedChannelIdentities(requestHeaders)` and
`revokeLinkedChannelIdentity(requestHeaders, identityId)` as async operations.
They verify the real Better Auth browser session, including its current database
row and expiry and current canonical workspace membership, and derive the owner
from that session. The browser never supplies a user ID. The existing account
creation path owns initial workspace provisioning; these controls never create
or restore membership.

The read operation returns active `{ id, channel, senderId }` records, using the
existing identity schema fields. Revocation delegates to `ChannelAccounts` and
returns `{ status: "revoked" }` or `{ status: "last_access" }`. The latter leaves
the identity and sessions intact. Other failures are typed `AccountControlError`
with `unauthenticated`, `identity_inactive` or `unavailable`; root tRPC maps them to
a safe public message. Successful revocation invalidates all browser sessions;
the account UI clears browser auth and returns to sign-in with an explanation.

`/account` and `/sign-in` share the form, status UI and HTTP client in
`web/auth/channel`. Link mode sends the existing `purpose: "link"` request to
Better Auth's channel challenge API. The existing backend owns the recent-session
requirement, browser cookie, messenger confirmation and same-session consumption.
The user explicitly opens the messenger and completes the confirmed request.
Link mode returns to `/account`; expired, conflicting and stale-session requests
have actionable states. Ordinary sign-in keeps its original copy and flow.

The focused integration check uses real PostgreSQL and Better Auth, creates
isolated synthetic channel identities, logs in and links through the public
Better Auth challenge endpoints, and confirms synthetic verified senders through
the real account service. It checks initial membership, ownership, denial after
membership removal, last-access preservation, revocation and session invalidation. It requires the
initialized `companion_runtime_test` database and makes no provider calls:

```sh
TELEGRAM_BOT_ID="account-controls-$(uuidgen)" TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME=account_controls_test_bot pnpm test:account-channels
```

Frontend tests render both purposes and exercise pure error presentation. They do
not count as qualification of live Telegram or WhatsApp delivery.

## Native browser login and account association

`NativeDeviceAuth` uses `channel_auth_challenge` for both `login` and `link`.
The request purpose is fixed at issuance; changing it on a retry, browser binding,
resume or native confirmation is rejected. A link request records the recent
Better Auth session and its owner when the browser binds. Confirmation and
consumption revalidate that same session, its expiry and canonical membership.
The native identity, source conversation, browser cookie and exact binding time
remain required. Completing a link never issues an additional login session.

WhatsApp's browser entry opens an ordinary conversation describing the chosen
purpose. The native `device-auth-start`, `device-auth-status` and
`device-auth-confirm` tools return the browser link and use the same explicit
approval boundary. Browser reload resumes using its signed cookie, without
retaining the entry token in browser storage.

This flow confirms an existing same-account association. A messenger already
associated with a different account returns an explicit conflict; no identity,
conversation, memory, integration or quota is transferred.

A first message from an unlinked messenger never creates a user or a workspace.
`resolveVerifiedSender` returns `{ status: "unlinked" }`, the webhook records the
address in `channel_pending_sender` through `recordUnlinkedContact`, and the
sender receives one instruction per 24 hours to sign in with Google and link the
messenger from the account page. Group messages from unlinked senders are ignored
without a database write. `login` challenges require an already linked identity
and fail with `sender_unlinked` otherwise. New `channel_identity` rows are written
only while a `link` challenge is consumed: `linkIdentity` inserts the confirmed
address and deletes its pending row, and `archive-transfer.ts` re-points the
addresses of an archived channel-first account.
`tests/runtime/unlinked-sender.integration.ts` and the unlinked-sender cases in
`tests/runtime/channel-webhook.integration.ts` are the integration proof. Accounts
that a channel-first contact created before this rule can still be joined to a
Google account only through the explicit archive path below.

`device-link.integration.ts` exercises real PostgreSQL and Better Auth for the
same-account path, purpose changes, two accounts, browser-session substitution,
freshness/expiry/revocation and concurrent one-use completion. These are domain
and HTTP proofs with synthetic identities, not live provider qualification.

## Account privacy export/delete gates

`privacy.ts` exposes authorized `exportAccountPrivacy(headers)` and
`deleteAccountOnlineData(headers)`. Both derive the owner from the live Better
Auth browser session plus canonical workspace membership. The browser never
supplies a user ID. Missing, expired or revoked credentials fail closed as
`AccountPrivacyError` with `unauthenticated` (HTTP 401) or `unavailable`
(HTTP 503).

### Limits (documented, not claimed complete)

- **Export** includes structured profile and bound profile notes only. Conversation
  history, artifacts, connected accounts, schedules, unbound memory documents,
  channel identities, browser sessions and backups are excluded.
- **Delete** wipes that same personal-memory surface and deletes Better Auth
  `session` rows for the user. It does **not** erase channel identities,
  schedules, artifacts, conversation history, the user/workspace rows, or
  backups. Do not claim full account deletion or backup erasure.
- **Full deletion** is `POST /api/account/erasure` / `requestAccountDeletion`.
  It erases the personal workspace, sessions, jobs, grants, connections and
  channel identities, keeps company workspaces, and writes a tombstone that
  a restore must reapply. After commit it attempts Vaultwarden, mautrix and
  Synapse wipes; those ledger rows become `erased` only on success. Mem0,
  backups and any unreachable provider stay `pending_external`. The last
  company admin must transfer or close company workspaces first. See
  `docs/decisions/adr-account-deletion.md`.

Org-scoped cascade of a company while members remain is **out of scope**.
See `docs/decisions/adr-c02-sso-audit-erasure.md` and
`shared/identity/org-erasure.ts` for fail-closed company erasure gates and
append-only audit receipts.

Full deletion proofs: `tests/runtime/account-deletion.integration.ts` and
`tests/runtime/account-deletion-providers.integration.ts`.

Deletion invokes the personal-memory wipe operation through its owning module. Fixture proof:
`server/accounts/privacy.test.ts` (fail-closed without auth; wipe never runs).
